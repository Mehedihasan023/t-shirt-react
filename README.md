Welcome to the T-Shirt with React practice project! This repository aims to help you sharpen your React skills by implementing various concepts and features. Feel free to explore the codebase and experiment with the following applied items:

## React Router

Implement navigation and routing within the application using React Router. Create dynamic and interactive user interfaces with multiple pages.
